### Computer Architecture Pipelining Emulator
Project from Computer Architecture course

##### Overview of Functionality
This project is intended to emulate the functionality of a CPU executing MIPS assembly instructions with pipelining implemented. The project builds upon the previous two projects from the course: ```lab2```
is an assembler that converts assembly instructions into a binary file; ```lab3``` emulates a CPU executing MIPS assembly instructions without pipelining. ```lab4``` implements
pipelining operations and also reports the contents of the pipeline for each instruction execution. The final output of the emulator is a report of the input assembly program's
runtime statistics, including CPI, total clock cycles operated on, and total instructions executed.

#### Usage
